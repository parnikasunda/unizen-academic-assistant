# Core Concepts Used in UniZen

This document explains the basic concepts used in the UniZen project in simple terms.

## Large Language Models (LLM)
A Large Language Model is an AI system trained on large amounts of text that can understand questions and generate human-like responses. In UniZen, the LLM is responsible for generating answers to student queries in natural language.

## Vector Databases
A vector database is used to store information in a numerical form so that similar pieces of text can be efficiently matched. Academic documents are converted into vectors so that relevant information can be retrieved based on student questions.

## Document-Based Question Answering
Instead of answering from general internet knowledge, UniZen retrieves information from verified academic documents to ensure accuracy and relevance.
