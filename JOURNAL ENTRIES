WEEK 1:
Topic: Large Language Models & Vector Databases (Introduction)
Work Done: Collected academic documents and designed system architecture for UniZen academic assistant.
Outcome: Prepared domain-specific knowledge base and defined system workflow.


WEEK 2:
Topic: Large Language Models and Vector Databases
Work Done: Studied core concepts and documented how LLMs and vector databases will be used in the UniZen academic assistant. Created initial project modules.
Outcome: Clear conceptual understanding of system components and data flow.

WEEK 3:
Topic: Document Processing
Work Done: Implemented basic document loading functionality to read academic text files.
Outcome: Prepared the foundation for storing and processing academic documents.

WEEK 4:
Topic: Text Chunking
Work Done: Implemented text chunking to divide academic documents into smaller, manageable segments.
Outcome: Improved document structure for efficient retrieval in later stages.

WEEK 5:
Topic: Vector Databases (Conceptual)
Work Done: Implemented structured storage of academic text chunks along with their source documents.
Outcome: Prepared the foundation for similarity-based retrieval in later stages.

WEEK 6:
Topic: Similarity Search
Work Done: Implemented basic similarity matching between user queries and academic text chunks using word overlap.
Outcome: Enabled retrieval of relevant academic content for answering student queries.

WEEK 7:
Topic: Large Language Models (Conceptual Integration)
Work Done: Implemented an answer generation interface that produces student-friendly responses using retrieved academic content.
Outcome: Enabled UniZen to generate meaningful academic answers.
